# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Overview
We've been asked to help create a report based on available cryptocurrency data in order to help Martha and the Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting make investment decisions. We need to use unsupervised machine learning to cluster and "classify" the various currencies according to some reduced dimensions (max 3- which allows for visualization). This will hopefully help in the review of what patterns are in the data set and ultimately what kinds of investments could be advantageous.

## Summary
In this project, we identified the classification of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities of their features. Through our analysis we could identify the outliers like there are not much cryptocurencies in class 2. Most of the cryptocurrencies are belonging to class 0 or class 1. Plotting the scatter plot from two cryptocurrency features directly does not efficiently segregate the different classes. The PCA algorithm is the right method for better visualizations. Unique details of each group need to be analyzed to determined their performance and potential interest for the investment bank's clients.
